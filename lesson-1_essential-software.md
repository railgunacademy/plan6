# Essential Software for Academics

Computers are an essential part of the academic researcher's routine as a tool to improve productivity. An appropriate collection of computer programs can help us save time in doing a variety of tasks- (1) Finding, reding and managing scientific content. This includes searching for scientific literature, saving and managing collection of journal articles. (2) Scientific computation, e.g. Writing programs for numerical modeling or carrying out complex calculations, generating data for journal articles, statistical analysis. (3) Writing journal articles and making presentations, collaborating with co-authors, managing and inserting citations, creating figures.

This session introduces some essential softwares beyond the ones that come with the standard operating systems. Naturally, with the use of computers in research, comes the responsibility to make sure the content is not lost. For example, protecting against deletion of files by error or damaged computer hardware or even theft of hardware. In that context, some softwares to protect the data are introduced as well.

## Emacs
* [OSX App](https://emacsformacosx.com/)
* [Windows](https://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/emacs/windows/)
* Linux: Generally installed by default

Emacs is a text editor just like Notepad, Wordpad or TextEdit. There are a few good reasons to use it instead of the default text editor in the operating system. First, it is very efficient when working with larger files. In the scientific community, files exceeding 10 MB in size are common. Second, it supports highligting and indentation of computer programs in many common programming languages. Highlighting chnages the color of different types of text in the computer program, e.g. a FOR loop directive will be shown in one color, text strings shown in another color. Indentation adds different left-indent to various blocks in the code. This makes editing computer programs very efficient and less error prone. Both features of Emacs are shown in the screenshot.
